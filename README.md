# untitled-bullet-hell
My semester project!! 
First of all, thanks for opening this file! It's always good convention to check the readme file, so props to you!! 
If you're reading this right now, this means that you must not be me, so you must be working on the art direction!! 
Which probably means that you most likely have never used github before coz it's kind of a programmer thing. 
So! I will explain this to you. 
You shall create a separate branch, and from that branch, you push whatever changes you make. 
For you, this should be the sprites you make. Upload your sprites to the indicated folder(indicated with a ♡) 
Then, push your changes to your personal branch, and I'll approve or deny your changes for the main branch. 
I hope we enjoy working together!♡ 
Love, Mili
